For weeks, we had toyed with the idea of mixing together Partida Reposado tequila and St-Germain elderflower liqueur, but there was a piece of the puzzle missing. Then one evening, a bunch of obnoxious cocktail geeks came intoEmployees Onlyto stump the bartenders by ordering theLast Wordcocktail. After being satisfied with that drink, they asked if we knew of another drink withChartreuse. At that moment,Yellow Chartreuse became the ingredient needed to bind together the elderflower and tequila. So pretty and elegant, the rich yellow color grabs your attention. The true beauty of this drink, though, is the interplay of the ingredients. The light oak on the Partida Reposado tequila works so well with the St-Germain, and they in turn produce a perfect ground for Yellow Chartreuse to bring it all into balance. The orange bitters play a key role. This cocktail is similar in style to the Widow’s Kiss cocktail, as they both contain very sweet herbaceous ingredients balanced by high alcohol content. It’s named for the yellow jacket wasps that inhabit agave farms and tequila distilleries.\n\nReprinted with permission fromSpeakeasyby Jason Kosmas and Dushan Zaric.

For her Banana Shadow, a smart variation on the popular banana Daiquiri, Wiseman builds around Giffard Banane du Brésil, created by manually macerating bananas imported from the South American country. With other banana liqueurs, it sometimes “feels like you’re drinking candy,” she says. “But here, you’re getting delicious, subtle tropical notes that are hard to achieve on your own.” Wiseman loves the inherent banana notes present in Magdalena Rum from Guatemala, as well as the nuttiness of Lustau Palo Cortado sherry, for their ability to round out the drink, punctuated by an unexpected hit of cardamom bitters.", "tags": ["Giffard"], "ingredients": ["1 ½ ounces Magdalena Rum", "½ ounce Lustau Palo Cortado sherry", "¼ ounce Giffard Banane du Brésil", "½ ounce simple syrup (1:1, sugar:water)", "1 dash cardamom bitters"], "instructions": ["1.

In numerous accounts, Professor Jerry Thomas claims its conception in 1847, having been quoted as naming it after himself and “two small white mice” he kept as pets called, of course, Tom and Jerry. However, reports of the warm, egg-based nog have been documented in America since the 1820s, and is sometimes even credited to English author Pierce Egan, who penned a play of the same name in 1821 (though there is no evidence to corroborate it in UK records). According to Dave Wondrich, the name does come indirectly from Egan. “To go Tom and Jerrying was to go out on the town, and a Tom and Jerry was also a low dive. And, in this case, a festive but lethal sort of drink,” says Wondrich. Though Thomas’s tale of ownership is a tall one, he became the drink’s greatest ambassador and, according to Dave Wondrich’sImbibe!,dedicated bowls were filled with batter each winter season across America until its popularity died down near the turn of the 20th century.

Then I can control how much sugar I can put in it. So that was it: Gin Mojito. My quest was helping people get over their phobia about gin.

I did a riff on the Gold Rush, which was one of our big sellers,” using Asyla. “Now, our ginger juice is sweetened, so it acts like a syrup. I split the sweetening between the two, the ginger and the honey. And it was great. Then I grabbed The Peat Monster—might as well play around with the smoky whiskey. I poured a float on top. That smoke stayed on the top. I preferred to never serve it with a straw. I want that smoke in the nose and that spicy sweet cocktail underneath.\n\n“I went to bed that night not thinking much of it. Like, ‘That was a good drink.’ It wasn’t until nine months later, at Little Branch, one of our waitresses, Lucinda Sterling, she came back from a table, and they all wanted Bartender’s Choices. She said I should put a Penicillin out because every table needs to experience one of them. It wasn’t until she said that, that I was like,Oh, maybe there’s something there.”\n\nThere was something there. In 2007, Sam Ross did some extensive consultancy work in Los Angeles, planting the seed of the drink in bars there. In the years since, the Penicillin has become as close to a household word as any cocktail since the Cosmopolitan. Philip Duff said the first time he had one, it was made for him by Australian bartender Naren Young in Germany, “which gives you an idea of how international it is.”\n\nAnother measure of the bartending community’s familiarity with the potion: you can often get one at cocktail bars that don’t even have it on the menu. By 2014, the Penicillin was so well known that some young bartenders assumed it was an old classic from way back.\n\nReprinted with permission fromAProper Drinkby Robert Simonson, copyright © 2016.

The punch has a tendency to be rather tannic tasting, so I add simple syrup cup by cup until the sweetness is just right.\n\nOne of the most tragic downfalls of a party punch is overdilution, which happens when the punch is chilled with fast-melting ice cubes.

It was first applied to a steaming bowl of ale and fortified wine, called the “wassail bowl,” around the 13th century, when it became common for medieval party-goers to dip bread and cakes into a big bowl of ale. (By the way, this practice of floating bread in a big bowl of liquid gave birth to our modern celebratory use of the word “toast.”) The wassail bowl’s contents continued to evolve, but the practice of communal “wassailing” survived all the way through the Renaissance. During the 17th century the wassail bowl took to the streets and became an offering of peace and prosperity during the holidays, carried from door to door, the verb “wassailing” eventually evolving to denote drunken revelry in a more general sense.\n\nWhen the puritans made their way to America, they brought the wassail bowl with them and it remained a fixture in America throughout the 19th century, giving birth to other wassail-like drinks, like theHot Toddyand eggnog.

In a scene now famous among cocktail dorks, Chuzzlewit, reacting to his first Sherry Cobbler, sums up the 19th-century sentiment around the drink: “Martin took the glass with an astonished look; applied his lips to the reed; and cast up his eyes once in ecstasy. He paused no more until the goblet was drained to the last drop. ‘This wonderful invention, sir,’ said Mark, tenderly patting the empty glass, ‘is called a cobbler. Sherry Cobbler when you name it long; cobbler, when you name it short.’” Certainly Chuzzlewit was astonished at the drink’s beauty, but also at the act of sipping through a straw—a novel concept at the time.

He specifies a strong formula of vodka, gin and Kina Lillet, “shaken, not stirred,” of course. Some historians have speculated that Bond slipped up in specifying Kina Lillet—a quinine-flavored white wine aperitif whose distillery also produced vermouth—intending for vermouth all along. The formula for Lillet has since changed, circa mid-1980s, making way for a new lighter, sweeter version with a lower dosage of quinine. As such, the classic Vesper specs may drown out the delicacy of Lillet’s contemporary recipe. To remedy, PUNCH suggests upping the proportion of Lillet. However, Cocchi Americano, a bittersweet Italian aperitivo, is probably the most accurate substitute for the Kina Lillet of days gone by. And though Bond said “shake,” we most definitely say, “stir.”\n\nPhoto originally published inBittersby Brad Thomas Parsons, copyright © 2011.

In a scene now well-known among cocktail geeks, Chuzzlewit’s reaction to the drink sums it up perfectly: “Martin took the glass, with an astonished look; applied his lips to the reed; and cast up his eyes once in ecstasy. He paused no more until the goblet was drained to the last drop… ‘This wonderful invention, Sir,’ said Mark, tenderly patting the empty glass, ‘is called a cobbler.

Said friend would then leave to find “Tom Collins” at the bar around the corner, sparking a goose chase of, perhaps, not-so-epic proportions.\n\nOr you can choose the British side, which (more likely) suggests that the Tom Collins was the creation of London bartender John Collins, who dreamed up an eponymous gin punch in the latter half of the 19thcentury, that, when made with Old Tom Gin, presumably became the Tom Collins. The first published recipe appears in Jerry Thomas’s 1876The Bartender’s Guide.By either route (or perhaps a combination of the two), the Tom Collins is a spritzy drink made of lemon, sugar, soda water and gin—which combine to form, what is essentially, the original hard lemonade.", "tags": ["Collins", "gin", "Old Tom gin"], "ingredients": ["1 1/2 ounces gin", "3/4 ounce lemon juice", "3/4 ounce simple syrup (1:1, sugar:water)", "soda water"], "instructions": ["1.
